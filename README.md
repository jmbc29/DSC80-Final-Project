**INTRODUCTION**

The dataset I have chosen is the League of Legends dataset from Oracle’s Elixir, which is stored in a CSV containing data from professional League of Legends competitive matches from 2014 to 2025. For this project, I decided to specifically on data from the 2022 season, as it contains a large number of recorded matches which will give me more data to analyze for my topic. Since the League of Legends gameplay environment changes significantly from year to year due to different strategies and popular game play metas, data from different seasons were not combined in this analysis.


**Questions I have about the dataset:**

1. What are some common attributes of winning teams?
2. Which position is most likely to accumulate the most gold?
3. How closely related are team kills and winning?
4. How important is placing wards when it comes to winning?
5. Do teams that achieve certain match objectives (firstdragon, firsttower, firstbaron) tend to win more often?
6. Can you predict a game's duration based on other features?
7. Can you predict what position someone played by other features?


I will investigate the relationship between vision control and gold advantage during a League of Legends match. While there are many interacting components that influence the outcome of a game, vision control is a strategic element that is often discussed qualitatively but less frequently analyzed quantitatively. Vision control refers to the management of map visibility through the placement of wards and the removal of enemy wards, allowing teams to track opponent movements and make informed strategic decisions. Effective vision control can enable safer farming, better objective control, and more efficient rotations, all of which may contribute to a team’s overall economic advantage.

Through my exploration of this dataset, I aim to answer the following question:

**Is vision advantage associated with higher gold advantage during a League of Legends match?**
